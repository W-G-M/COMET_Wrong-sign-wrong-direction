# Electron/Positron Gun

This directory contains the scripts needed to run a particle gun SimG4 simulation of CyDet. The particles that we "shoot" are 
electrons and positrons from the TargetDisk with an energy of 104.97 MeV, which is the charasteristic electron energy expected 
from muon to electron conversion process.

This is done in the context of comparison studies between signal electrons and a "signal-like" positron to study 
wrong-sign/wrong-direction backgrounds.
